This GitHub repository showcases a web application named "Cocktail Finder," which allows users to search for cocktail recipes based on their names or first letters. The app provides a user-friendly interface to discover a wide range of cocktail recipes with detailed ingredients, measurements, instructions, and images.

Technology used :

I built the application using Node.js and Express, harnessing the power of JavaScript for server-side functionality. 
To facilitate API integration, I utilized Axios, a promise-based HTTP client. With Axios, I ensured smooth interactions with TheCocktailDB API, managing error handling and data rendering with ease. To create dynamic and real-time content on the frontend, I opted for EJS (Embedded JavaScript) templates. These templates allow me to inject fetched cocktail data into HTML, enhancing the user experience.

 I implemented responsive CSS styling. My application's design adapts gracefully to different devices, making it visually appealing across desktop and mobile screens. To add a modern touch, I designed gradient backgrounds using CSS animations. The dynamic background further elevates the application's visual appeal.

Throughout the development process, I prioritized robust error handling and validation. I ensured the application gracefully manages situations when no cocktail data is available or when errors occur during data fetching. I implemented input validation on the frontend to guarantee essential information is provided when submitting the search form.

To enhance readability and style, I integrated attractive font styles from Google Fonts across various elements of the application. This helps create a visually appealing and cohesive user interface.

Version control played a crucial role in my development process. I used Git to organize my codebase efficiently, enabling collaborative development and ensuring easy code management.
